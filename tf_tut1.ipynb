    "* Flexibility: TensorFlow caters to diverse ML tasks, encompassing image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and recommender systems.\n",
    "* Scalability: Seamlessly handle large datasets and complex models on various hardware platforms, from single machines to powerful TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in the cloud.\n",
    "* Open-Source Community: Benefit from a vibrant community of developers, extensive documentation, and a plethora of tutorials and resources to expedite your learning.\n",
    "* TensorBoard Visualization: TensorBoard, a built-in visualization suite, aids in monitoring model training progress, analyzing performance metrics, and debugging issues.* TensorFlow is well-documented and includes plenty of machine learning libraries\n",
